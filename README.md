# Image Recognition Project using Google Teachable Machine

This project demonstrates training an image recognition model using Google Teachable Machine with at least two classes, exporting the model in TensorFlow Keras format, and writing a Python script to predict the class of input images.

## Project Files

- `keras_model.h5`  
  The trained model exported from Teachable Machine in Keras format.

- `predict.py`  
  Python script that loads the trained model, accepts an input image, and predicts its class.

- `teachable_machine_result.png`   
  Screenshot showing the model training results from Teachable Machine.

- `python_output.png` 
  Screenshot showing the output of running the Python prediction script.

## Steps Followed

1. Trained the model using Google Teachable Machine with at least two classes.

2. Exported the trained model in TensorFlow Keras format.

3. Created a Python script to load the model, preprocess input images, and predict their class.

4. Tested the Python script with sample images and captured the output.

5. Prepared this repository with all files and documentation.
